1. **Initial Setup**
   
   On the first time opening this project, run the following command in your terminal to install all necessary node modules:
   
  ### `npm install`


2. **Starting the Development Server**

   To start running the project in development mode, navigate to the project directory and execute:
   
   ### `npm start`
   
   This command will launch the app and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code. Additionally, you may see any lint errors in the console.

## Website Pages
The photos are not enough, you should go and explore the website by yourself :>

1. **Homepage**
   
   The homepage of the Crispy Crumbs website features a search bar at the top, along with buttons for sorting videos by "Newest" and "Most Watched." A video thumbnail with details such as views, upload date, and title is displayed.
   
   - The top-bar displays login and sign-up options if the user isn't registered. If the user is registered, the top-bar will display an upload video button and a profile photo of the registered user. Clicking on the profile photo opens a popup menu with additional options. The top-bar also includes the logo, a search bar (to be functional in the next exercise), and a light/dark mode toggle (the night mode looks awesome :>).

## Work process -  
Our project was built collaboratively as a team. 
Initially, we planned the work together using Jira and divided the tasks among us. 

We created mockups for the website and application pages using Figma, and then we started working on the code for both the application and the website. The process was educational, and we thoroughly enjoyed the journey.
